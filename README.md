This project was under the umbrella project, everyday.in.th, and it built with react and powered by GraphQL server.

Check out the production site at [showtimesth.com](https://showtimesth.com).

## Why?

It started way back since big cinema chains didn't really have a usable website. That was no longer the case; but we still think this is a better way to find information we want regardless of limiting to any chain. And, an honest reason is it's _fun_ to code.


## How to run

While we prefer `yarn`, `npm` should work too.

    yarn start

## License

Do whatever you want with it. It definitely is not the cleaniest code nor the most efficient one, but it works good enough.
